#' @title A direct approximation of the sensitivity of life expectancy at birth to changes in mortality.
#' @description This function tries to get the direct discrete life expectancy sensitivity to \eqn{m(x)}, in continous math it's \eqn{-l(x)e(x)}, we just need to find the best approx with a discrete lifetable.
#' This direct lifetable-based calculation requires a few approximations to get a usable value whenever we're working with discrete data.
#' In continuous notation, we know that the sensitivity \eqn{s(x)}
#' \deqn{s(x) = -l(x)e(x)}
#' but it is not obvious what to use from a discrete lifetable. In this implementation, we use \eqn{L(x)} and an \eqn{a(x)}-weighted average of successive \eqn{e(x)} values, specifically, we calculate:
#' \deqn{
#' s_x = -L_x \cdot \left( e_x \cdot \left( 1 - a_x \right) + e_{x+1} \cdot a_x\right)
#' }
#' This seems to be a very good approximation for ages >0, but we still have a small, but unaccounted-for discrepancy in age 0, at least when comparing with also-imperfect numerical derivatives.
